# Game_code development 
water sort puzzle game code: 
## <Heading 2> WATERSORT 
PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT : the purpose of this project is to create a puzzle 
solving game. the game is made up of 5 bottles . each bottle is filled with
different colours. The puzzle is in the solved state once all the bottles 
have the same colors. 
This project allowed me to have a different approach to problem solving and
therefore improved my problem solving skills. this practical also showed me 
how fun puzzle solving games can be very easy to make when coding in backend.
